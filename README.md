# gridics-page
Zurb Foundation framework ver 6.0.2 was used in index.html.
Fatal error in displaying "sticky" elements after scrolling page.
The second option of imposition is added (index2.html).
Imposition not completely corresponds to design of the page as the main objective was to show the correct operation of Zurb of the fifth version on an element with a class sticky.
